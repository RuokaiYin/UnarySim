## Unary Computing
_**Unary Computing**_ is a type of computing paradigm based on serial bits in streams, rather than parallel data in conventional binary computing. 
The unary computing kernels are much simpler than conventional binary counterparts, but spend more cycles for a single operation. 
But due to the higher computing density resulting from simple logic, unary computing can achieve even higher energy efficiency than binary computing when the computing density reaches a certain threshold [1].

## UnarySim
This _**UnarySim**_ is a PyTorch-based cycle-accurate simulator for large scale unary computing.
